% \todo[inline, backgroundcolor=kth-lightgreen]{GLENNE HARRIE OLLESSON Exchange students many want to include one or more abstracts in the language(s) used in their home institutions to avoid the need to write another thesis when returning to their home institution.}

% \todo[inline]{Keep in mind that most of your potential readers are only going to read your \texttt{title} and \texttt{abstract}. This is why it is important that the abstract give them enough information that they can decide is this document relevant to them or not. Otherwise the likely default choice is to ignore the rest of your document.\\

% A abstract should stand on its own, i.e., no citations, cross references to the body of the document, acronyms must be spelled out, \ldots .\\

% Write this early and revise as necessary. This will help keep you focused on what you are trying to do.}

Write an abstract that is about 250 and 350 words (1/2 A4-page)  with the following components:: % key parts of the abstract
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the topic area? (optional) Introduces the subject area for the project.
  \item Short problem statement
  \item Why was this problem worth a Bachelor's/Master’s thesis project? (\ie, why is the problem both significant and of a suitable degree of difficulty for a Bachelor's/Master’s thesis project? Why has no one else solved it yet?)
  \item How did you solve the problem? What was your method/insight?
  \item Results/Conclusions/Consequences/Impact: What are your key results/\linebreak[4]conclusions? What will others do based upon your results? What can be done now that you have finished - that could not be done before your thesis project was completed?
\end{itemize}
