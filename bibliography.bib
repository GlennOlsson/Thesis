	abstract = {With the development of multimedia and the popularity of social cloud (SC), Quality of Service (QoS) is used to measure the technical parameters of service delivery. QoS is mostly used for measuring various kinds of multimedia data. Sharing (uploading) on SC has become the daily activity of end-users. As a result of this activity, it provides an open challenge for service providers. As a service provider, the host delivers productive infrastructure, allowing end-users to upload and share their high-quality images. To evaluate the QoS of image compression, we conduct objective QoS techniques to measure the efficiency of image quality and QoS performance of service delivery via uploading /downloading of images on three popular SC, (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram). These social clouds and image services are compared by the mean, standard deviation (STDEV),mean square error (MSE), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). So we can achieve better results about the SC image quality. The results show that Instagram and Facebook compressed images more as compared to Twitter. However, Twitter less supports image formats and provides an acceptable quality of compressed images as compared to others. Therefore, Facebook supports all image file formats and enhanced (QoE) levels of end-users, but Twitter provided the best QoS of compressed images as compared to Instagram. Further, we found that the decrease of MSE and increase of SNR both have a high impact on image resolutions as compared to original image parameters, which has a higher effect on quality. For the specific quality assurance of image tasks acquired for robust automated image analysis research, we are also using deep learning techniques (DLT) to classify the quality of images. We also have identified the opportunity to simplify the Convolutional Neural network (CNN) with smaller resampling grids and making this process more suitable for at least five thousand (5000) of the enormous datasets available in the future.},

The proposed scheme aims to identify encrypted JPEG images that are generated from an original JPEG image. To store images without any visual sensitive information on photo sharing services, grayscale-based JPEG images are generated by using the grayscale-based encryption method. The use of the grayscale-based JPEG images and feature vectors extracted from the JPEG images allows us to identify images not only recompressed multiple times but re-encrypted with different keys. In an experiment, the proposed scheme is shown to have a high identification performance, even when images are recompressed multiple times and re-encrypted with different keys.},

	abstract = {The designers of communication networks are being challenged by the emergence of a new class of addressing and routing scheme referred to as content-based addressing and routing. This new approach differs from traditional unicast and multicast schemes in that it performs routing based on the data being transported in a message rather than on any specialized addressing and routing information attached to, or otherwise associated with, the message. An example of an application for content-based addressing and routing is an event notiﬁcation service, which is a general-purpose facility for asynchronously and implicitly conveying information from generators of events to any and all parties expressing interest in those events. In order to implement content-based addressing and routing, we can adopt well-known and successful network architectures and protocols, provided that we understand how to map the core concepts and functionalities of content-based addressing and routing onto this established infrastructure. Toward that end, we have formulated a general, yet powerful model of addressing and routing that allows us to formalize the crucial aspects of content-based addressing and routing in a surprisingly simple manner. Furthermore, it allows us to treat traditional unicast and multicast addressing and routing uniformly as instances of this more general model. This paper presents our model and demonstrates its utility by showing its application to the design of an existing event notiﬁcation service.},

As with all online images, they are often poorly annotated, resulting in a difficult retrieval scenario. To overcome this problem, many photo tag recommendation methods have been introduced, however, these methods all rely on historical Flickr data which is often problematic for a number of reasons, including the time lag problem (i.e. in our collection, users upload images on average 50 days after taking them, meaning "training data" is often out of date). In this paper, we develop an image annotation model which exploits textual content from related Twitter and Wikipedia data which aims to overcome the discussed problems. The results of our experiments show and highlight the merits of exploiting social media data for annotating event images, where we are able to achieve recommendation accuracy comparable with a state-of-the-art model.},
