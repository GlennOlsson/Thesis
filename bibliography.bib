At the same time, OSNs have become primary targets of tracking, profiling, as well as censorship and surveillance. In this paper, we explore the notion of undetectable communication in OSNs and introduce formal definitions, alongside system and adversarial models, that complement better understood notions of anonymity and confidentiality. We present a novel scheme for secure covert information sharing that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve undetectable communication in OSNs. We demonstrate, via an open-source prototype, that additional costs are tolerably low.},

  abstract = {In this paper we analyze for the first time the post-quantum security of AES. AES is the most popular and widely used block cipher, established as the encryption standard by the NIST in 2001. We consider the secret key setting and, in particular, AES-256, the recommended primitive and one of the few existing ones that aims at providing a post-quantum security of 128 bits. In order to determine the new security margin, i.e., the lowest number of non-attacked rounds in time less than 2\^128 encryptions, we first provide generalized and quantized versions of the best known cryptanalysis on reduced-round AES, as well as a discussion on attacks that don't seem to benefit from a significant quantum speed-up. We propose a new framework for structured search that encompasses both the classical and quantum attacks we present, and allows to efficiently compute their complexity. We believe this framework will be useful for future analysis. Our best attack is a quantum Demirci-Selçuk meet-in-the-middle attack. Unexpectedly , using the ideas underlying its design principle also enables us to obtain new, counter-intuitive classical TMD trade-offs. In particular, we can reduce the memory in some attacks against AES-256 and AES-128. One of the building blocks of our attacks is solving efficiently the AES S-Box differential equation, with respect to the quantum cost of a reversible S-Box. We believe that this generic quantum tool will be useful for future quantum differential attacks. Judging by the results obtained so far, AES seems a resistant primitive in the post-quantum world as well as in the classical one, with a bigger security margin with respect to quantum generic attacks.},

  pages = {15},
  abstract = {The designers of communication networks are being challenged by the emergence of a new class of addressing and routing scheme referred to as content-based addressing and routing. This new approach differs from traditional unicast and multicast schemes in that it performs routing based on the data being transported in a message rather than on any specialized addressing and routing information attached to, or otherwise associated with, the message. An example of an application for content-based addressing and routing is an event notification service, which is a general-purpose facility for asynchronously and implicitly conveying information from generators of events to any and all parties expressing interest in those events. In order to implement content-based addressing and routing, we can adopt well-known and successful network architectures and protocols, provided that we understand how to map the core concepts and functionalities of content-based addressing and routing onto this established infrastructure. Toward that end, we have formulated a general, yet powerful model of addressing and routing that allows us to formalize the crucial aspects of content-based addressing and routing in a surprisingly simple manner. Furthermore, it allows us to treat traditional unicast and multicast addressing and routing uniformly as instances of this more general model. This paper presents our model and demonstrates its utility by showing its application to the design of an existing event notification service.},

Hammertoss is one of the image based stegomalware which was studied and selected for implementation (four different implementations).It is a Firewall resistant extremely stealth Remote Access Trojan (RAT).Based on the above, various existing stego-malware prevention and detection techniques have been studied and new methods have been proposed. The new proposals related to stegomalware prevention includes, a Digital Signature based scheme for authenticated installation of applications and an Active Warden attacks based scheme on downloaded Stego-Images. The existing image based stegomalware detection techniques includes malware detection techniques and image steganalysis techniques. By combining these existing techniques, a category wise detection approach for each type of stegomalware is proposed. Also after studying several Steganalysis techniques, two new Spatial Domain Image Steganalysis techniques are proposed, implemented and analysed. The outcomes of this research project can provide vital insights for detection and prevention of such attacks and can significantly improve the state of our Cyber Security Preparedness.}

  abstract = {Steganography or data hiding is used to protect the privacy of information in the transit; it has been observed that the information that flows through Online Social Networks (OSN) is very much unsafe. Therefore, people hesitate to communicate their sensitive data on social media.. Most of the information on the online social network is not useful to users and appears to disregard such details. People’s actions provided a possibility for digital Steganography through the Internet.. TCPIP covert channels were used for steganography until the last decade. People began to utilize social media as a covert conduit to communicate hidden messages to targeted users as social media grew in popularity. There are numerous Online Social Networks accessible nowadays, ranging from Facebook to the more contemporary Twitter and Instagram. All of them may be utilized as covert channels without the general public noticing. The primary characteristic of steganography is the protection of information privacy; nonetheless, it has been utilized more for illicit message transmission, which is a source of concern. To make matters worse, adversaries are using steganalysis techniques to mess with the concealed data. In this article, we examine the different social media steganography techniques, such as those used on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter, as well as the difficulties that these approaches raise. The positive and negative consequences of social media, as well as its current state, are discussed in this study. This paper discusses how the performances of Steganography methods may be assessed using the Entropy value of the Stego object. A look of the three features of steganography. It has been given with undetectability, robustness, and payload capacity. Finally, the paper’s concept’s future scope is explored.},

On Facebook, information hidden in image files will be further obscured within the millions of pictures and other images posted and transmitted daily. Facebook is known to alter and compress uploaded images so they use minimum space and bandwidth when displayed on Facebook pages. The compression process generally disrupts attempts to use Facebook for image steganography.

The proposed scheme aims to identify encrypted JPEG images that are generated from an original JPEG image. To store images without any visual sensitive information on photo sharing services, grayscale-based JPEG images are generated by using the grayscale-based encryption method. The use of the grayscale-based JPEG images and feature vectors extracted from the JPEG images allows us to identify images not only recompressed multiple times but re-encrypted with different keys. In an experiment, the proposed scheme is shown to have a high identification performance, even when images are recompressed multiple times and re-encrypted with different keys.},

  abstract = {With the development of multimedia and the popularity of social cloud (SC), Quality of Service (QoS) is used to measure the technical parameters of service delivery. QoS is mostly used for measuring various kinds of multimedia data. Sharing (uploading) on SC has become the daily activity of end-users. As a result of this activity, it provides an open challenge for service providers. As a service provider, the host delivers productive infrastructure, allowing end-users to upload and share their high-quality images. To evaluate the QoS of image compression, we conduct objective QoS techniques to measure the efficiency of image quality and QoS performance of service delivery via uploading /downloading of images on three popular SC, (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram). These social clouds and image services are compared by the mean, standard deviation (STDEV),mean square error (MSE), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). So we can achieve better results about the SC image quality. The results show that Instagram and Facebook compressed images more as compared to Twitter. However, Twitter less supports image formats and provides an acceptable quality of compressed images as compared to others. Therefore, Facebook supports all image file formats and enhanced (QoE) levels of end-users, but Twitter provided the best QoS of compressed images as compared to Instagram. Further, we found that the decrease of MSE and increase of SNR both have a high impact on image resolutions as compared to original image parameters, which has a higher effect on quality. For the specific quality assurance of image tasks acquired for robust automated image analysis research, we are also using deep learning techniques (DLT) to classify the quality of images. We also have identified the opportunity to simplify the Convolutional Neural network (CNN) with smaller resampling grids and making this process more suitable for at least five thousand (5000) of the enormous datasets available in the future.},

However, encryption schemes are generally not directly compatible with user passwords and thus, Password-Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDFs) are used to convert user passwords into cryptographic keys. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical security of PBKDF2 and present two vulnerabilities, γ-collision and δ-collision. Using AES-128 as our exemplar, we show that due to γ-collision, text encrypted with one user password can be decrypted with γ 1 different passwords. We also provide a proof that finding− a collision in the derived key for AES-128 requires δ lesser calls to PBKDF2 than the known Birthday attack. Due to this, it is possible to break password-based AES-128 in O(264) calls, which is equivalent to brute-forcing DES.},

  abstract = {In spite of the central role of key derivation functions (KDF) in applied cryptography, there has been little formal work addressing the design and analysis of general multi-purpose KDFs. In practice, most KDFs (including those widely standardized) follow ad-hoc approaches that treat cryptographic hash functions as perfectly random functions. In this paper we close some gaps between theory and practice by contributing to the study and engineering of KDFs in several ways. We provide detailed rationale for the design of KDFs based on the extract-then-expand approach; we present the first general and rigorous definition of KDFs and their security which we base on the notion of computational extractors; we specify a concrete fully practical KDF based on the HMAC construction; and we provide an analysis of this construction based on the extraction and pseudorandom properties of HMAC. The resultant KDF design can support a large variety of KDF applications under suitable assumptions on the underlying hash function; particular attention and effort is devoted to minimizing these assumptions as much as possible for each usage scenario. Beyond the theoretical interest in modeling KDFs, this work is intended to address two important and timely needs of cryptographic applications: (i) providing a single hash-based KDF design that can be standardized for use in multiple and diverse applications, and (ii) providing a conservative, yet efficient, design that exercises much care in the way it utilizes a cryptographic hash function. (The HMAC-based scheme presented here, named HKDF, is being standardized by the IETF.)Corrects a typo in original version: The example at the top of page 12, using a function from \{0,1\}\^\{k+1\} -{$>$} \{0,1\}\^k, was mistakenly written before as \{0,1\}\^\{2k\} -{$>$} \{0,1\}\^k.},

As with all online images, they are often poorly annotated, resulting in a difficult retrieval scenario. To overcome this problem, many photo tag recommendation methods have been introduced, however, these methods all rely on historical Flickr data which is often problematic for a number of reasons, including the time lag problem (i.e. in our collection, users upload images on average 50 days after taking them, meaning "training data" is often out of date). In this paper, we develop an image annotation model which exploits textual content from related Twitter and Wikipedia data which aims to overcome the discussed problems. The results of our experiments show and highlight the merits of exploiting social media data for annotating event images, where we are able to achieve recommendation accuracy comparable with a state-of-the-art model.},

  abstract = {Recently, there have been proposals to evade censors by using steganography to embed secret messages in images shared on public photo-sharing sites. However, establishing a covert channel in this manner is not straightforward. First, photo-sharing sites often process uploaded images, thus destroying any embedded message. Second, prior work assumes the existence of an out-of-band channel, using which the communicating users can exchange metadata or secret keys a priori; establishing such out-of-band channels, not monitored by censors, is difficult. In this paper, we address these issues to facilitate private communications on photo-sharing sites. In doing so, first, we conduct an in-depth measurement study of the feasibility of hiding data on four popular photo-sharing sites. Second, based on the understanding derived, we propose a novel approach for embedding secret messages in uploaded photos while preserving the integrity of such messages. We demonstrate that, despite the processing on photo-sharing sites, our approach ensures reliable covert communication, without increasing the likelihood of being detected via steganalysis. Lastly, we design and implement a scheme for bootstrapping private communications without an out-of-band channel, i.e., by exchanging keys via uploaded images.},

  abstract = {Plagiarism is a common problem in the academic world. Multiple studies show that over 30 \% of students attending introductory university programming courses plagiarise their code at least once. However, as opposed to plagiarism of academic texts, plagiarised code is harder to discover as subtle changes can be made, for instance renaming variables. The field of code plagiarism is not uncharted and there are indeed a few suggested approaches. This thesis investigates if it is possible to combine multiple plagiarism detection techniques into a user-friendly tool intended for examiners of introductory programming courses. The tool, named DecPlag, not only checks for plagiarism between new submissions, but also keeps a database of previous course iterations so that foul play can be discovered between new students and older students as well. The resulting tool developed for the research turned out to become slow, taking multiple days to finish comparing the data of two course iterations. It also outputs a large number of false positives due to the structure of the research data. However, DecPlag did indeed find potential plagiarism cases as well.},

  abstract = {A novel grayscale-based block scrambling image encryption scheme is presented not only to enhance security, but also to improve the compression performance for Encryption-then-Compression (EtC) systems with JPEG compression, which are used to securely transmit images through an untrusted channel provider. The proposed scheme enables the use of a smaller block size and a larger number of blocks than the color-based image encryption scheme. Images encrypted using the proposed scheme include less color information due to the use of grayscale images even when the original image has three color channels. These features enhance security against various attacks, such as jigsaw puzzle solver and brute-force attacks. Moreover, generating the grayscale-based images from a full-color image in YCbCr color space allows the use of color sub-sampling operation, which can provide the higher compression performance than the conventional grayscale-based encryption scheme, although the encrypted images have no color information. In an experiment, encrypted images were uploaded to and then downloaded from Twitter and Facebook, and the results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is effective for EtC systems and enhances the compression performance, while maintaining the security against brute-force and jigsaw puzzle solver attacks.},

In order to make steganography accessible from laboratory to practical applications, it becomes critical that the stego images can resist JPEG compression from transmission channel. In this paper, an image steganography algorithm with strong robustness to resist JPEG compression is proposed. First, the robust cover elements are selected using the sign of DCT coefficients which are kept constant before and after JPEG compression. Additionally, a distortion function and a weighted cost adjustment method are designed to assign an appropriate cost to each candidate DCT coefficient. Finally, the message is embedded in the cover image which has minimal embedding distortion by flipping the signs of DCT coefficients, while differential Manchester code is applied to the element positions to obtain the location feature. Compared with the prior art, our algorithm has better undetectability and stronger robustness, and it can resist the attacks from the social network platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WeChat.},

  abstract = {Data encryption has become an increasingly important factor in everyday work. Users seek a method of securing their data with maximum comfort and minimum additional requirements on their part; they want a security system that protects any files used by any of their applications, without resorting to application-specific encryption methods. Performance is an important factor to users since encryption can be time consuming. Operating system vendors want to provide this functionality but without incurring the large costs of developing a new file system. This paper describes the design and implementation of Cryptfs -- a file system that was designed as a stackable Vnode layer loadable kernel module. Cryptfs operates by 'encapsulating' a client file system with a layer of encryption transparent to the user. Being kernel resident, Cryptfs performs better than user-level or NFS based file servers such as CFS and TCFS. It is 2 to 37 times faster on micro-benchmarks such as read and write; this translates to 12-52\textbackslash\%application speedup, as exemplified by a large build. Cryptfs offers stronger security by basing its keys on process session IDs as well as user IDs, and by the fact that kernel memory is harder to access. Working at and above the vnode level, Cryptfs is more portable than a file system which works directly with native media such as disks and networks. Cryptfs can operate on top of any other native file system such as UFS/FFS and NFS. Finally, Cryptfs requires no changes to client file systems or remote servers.},
