% \todo[inline]{When you do your literature study, you should have a nearly complete Chapters 1 and 2.\\
% You may also find it convenient to introduce the future work section into your report early – so that you can put things that you think about but decide not to do now into this section.\\
% Note that later you can move things between this future work section and what you have done as you may change your mind about what to do now versus what to put off to future work.

% What have others already done? (This is the “related work”.) Explain what and

% This chapter provides basic background information about xxx. Additionally, this chapter describes xxx. The chapter also describes related work xxxx.

This chapter presents concepts and theory that is relevant for understanding, implementing, and evaluating \gls{FFS}. Data storage principles of filesystems and the idea of \mbox{inode-based} filesystems is presented in \Cref{sec:fs_data_store}. \Cref{sec:fuse} introduces the \gls{FUSE} library that will be used to implement \gls{FFS}. \Cref{sec:ows} presents background information about \glspl{OWS}, such as Twitter. \Cref{sec:back_crypto} presents theory about the cryptographic methodologies used by \gls{FFS} to encrypt and decrypt the data. \Cref{sec:introTreats} presents some threats, including potential adversaries of \gls{FFS}.
