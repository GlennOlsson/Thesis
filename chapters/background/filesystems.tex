\section{Filesystems}
Filesystems are used to store data on for instance a hard drive of a computer. Google Drive is another file system that enables user to save their data online up to 15 GB for free\cite{noauthor_cloud_nodate} using their clusters of distributed storage devices, meaning that the data is saved on theirs servers which can be located wherever\cite{noauthor_distributed_nodate}. Paying customers can achieve higher amount of storage using the service.

A deniable filesystem is a system that does not expose files stored on this system without credentials - neither how many files are stored, their sizes, their content or even if there exists any files on the filesystem\cite{peters_defy_2014}. This is useful if for example one is to be exposed to an audit of their data by a totalitarian regim where they don't even want to disclose that they have data.
