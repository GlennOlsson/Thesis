\section{Filesystems}
Filesystems are used to store data on for instance a hard drive of a computer in the cloud. Google Drive is a filesystem that enables users to save their data online up to 15 GB for free\cite{CloudStorageWork} using their clusters of distributed storage devices, meaning that the data is saved on their servers which can be located wherever\cite{DistributedStorageWhat}. Paying customers can achieve a higher amount of storage using the service.

A deniable filesystem is a system that does not expose files stored on this system without credentials - neither how many files are stored, their sizes, their content, or even if there exist any files on the filesystem\cite{petersDEFYDeniableFile2014}. This is useful if for example one is to be exposed to an audit of their data by a totalitarian regime where they don't even want to disclose that they have data.

A Unix filesystem uses a data structure called an \textit{inode}. An inode keeps track of the metadata for the files in the filesystem, and a directory simply contains the file names and each file or directory's inode id. Using a lookup, the system can then learn about the file - for instance where it is located and how big it is as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:inode_diag} (\textbf{CITATION NEEDED}). Each inode entry can contain any number of metadata information that might be relevant for the system, such as creation time and last updated.

Looking at the 4 main file systems of windows, they all have many, sometimes different, functionalities such as links and named streams as well limitations such as a defined theoretical maximum file size\cite{mikbenFileSystemFunctionality}. This is set to 16 exbibytes for NTFS, exFAT, and UDF, and for FAT32 it is set to 4 gigabytes.
