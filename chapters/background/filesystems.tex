\section{Filesystems}
Filesystems are used to store data on for instance a hard drive of a computer locally or in the cloud. For example, Google Drive is a filesystem that enables users to save their data online with up to 15 GB for free\cite{CloudStorageWork} using their clusters of distributed storage devices, meaning that the data is saved on their servers which can be located wherever\cite{DistributedStorageWhat}. Paying customers can have a greater amount of storage using the service.

A Unix filesystem uses a data structure called an \textit{inode}. An inode keeps track of the metadata for the files in the filesystem, and a directory simply contains the file names and each file or directory's inode id. Using a lookup, the system can then learn about the file - for instance where it is located and how big it is as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:inode_diag} % FIXME: CITATION NEEDED 
Each inode entry can contain any metadata that might be relevant for the system, such as creation time and last update time.

Looking at the four main file systems of Microsoft's Windows, there are functionalities present in some systems that are not found in others, for instance links and named streams. There is also other trade-offs such as a defined theoretical maximum file size\cite{mikbenFileSystemFunctionality} for the filesystems. This is set to 16 exbibytes for NTFS, exFAT, and UDF, while for FAT32 it is four gigabytes. 

\subsection{Image structures}
Different file types have different protocols and definitions of how they should be encoded and decoded, for instance a JPEG and a PNG file can be used to display similar content but the data they store is different. At the lowest level, files often consist of a string of binary digits no matter the file type. If one would represent an arbitrary file of $X$ bytes, each byte (0x00 - 0xFF) can be represented as a character such as the Extended ASCII (EASCII) keyset and we can therefore decode this file as $X$ different characters. Using the same set of characters for encoding and decoding we can get a symmetric relation for representing a file as a string of characters. EASCII is only one example of such a set of characters, any set of characters with 256 different symbols can be used to create such a symmetric relation.

% TODO: Specify in second sentence that the pixel is 8-bit RBG value
This string of $X$ bytes can also be used as the data in an image. An image can be abstracted as a $h * w$ matrix, where each element is a pixel. Each pixel represents a color which can be represented as a number. One can therefore imagine that we can use this string of $X$ bytes to assign colors in this color matrix by assigning the first $Y$ bytes as the first pixel's color, the next $Y$ bytes as the following pixel's color and so forth. The value of $Y$ depends on the color type and depth of the image, for simplicity we can imagine an 8-bit RGB value, i.e. $Y$ is three bytes (one byte per Red, Green and Blue). This means that $X$ bytes of data can be represented as 
$$ceil(\frac{X}{3})$$ 
pixels, where $ceil$ rounds a float to the closest larger integer. For a file of \SI{1}{\mega\byte}, i.e. $X = 1\,000\,000$ we need $333\,334$ pixels. The values of $h$ and $w$ are arbitrary but if we for instance want a square image we can set $ h\,=\,w\,=\,578$ which means that there will be $334\,084$ pixels in total, and the remaining $750$ pixels will just be fillers to make the image a reasonable size. However, we could choose $h = 1$ and $w = 333\,334$ which would mean a very wide image but would not require filler pixels.
