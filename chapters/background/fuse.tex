\section{FUSE}
Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a library that provides an interface to create filesystems in userspace rather than in kernel space which is otherwise often considered the standard when writing commercial filesystems\cite{Libfuse2021}. The reason is that it leads to faster system calls than when writing a filesystem in userspace. However, while filesystems written with FUSE are generally slower than a kernel-based filesystem, it simplifies the process of creating filesystems. macFUSE is a port of FUSE that operates on Apple's macOS operating system that extends the FUSE API\cite{HomeMacFUSE}. macFUSE provides an API for C and Objective C.
