\section{Online web services}
\label{sec:ows}
This section presents two \gls{OWS}s, Twitter and Flickr, where one can create \mbox{free-tier} accounts. On both of these \gls{OWS}s, \mbox{free-tier} accounts can make numerous posts for free. The \gls{OWS}s each provide a \mbox{free-to-use} \gls{API} for \mbox{non-commercial} development. 

\subsection{Twitter}
\label{subsec:ows_twitter}
Twitter is a \mbox{micro-blog} online where users can sign up for a free account and create public posts (tweets) using text, images, and videos. Each post has a uniqueIDassociated with it\,\cite{twitterTwitterIDs}. Text posts are limited to $280$ characters while images can be up to \SI{5}{\mega\byte} and videos up to \SI{512}{\mega\byte}\,\cite{MediaBestPractices}. A post with images can contain up to four images in one post. There is also a possibility to send private messages to other accounts, where each message can contain up to $10\,000$ characters and the same limitations on files. However, direct messages older than $30$ days are not possible to retrieve through Twitter's \gls{API}\,\cite{RetrievingOlder302018}. It is possible to create threads of Twitter posts where multiple tweets can be associated in chronological order.

Twitter's \gls{API} defines technical limits of how many times certain actions can be executed by a user\,\cite{UnderstandingTwitterLimits}. A maximum of $2\,400$ tweets can be sent per day, and the limit is further broken down into smaller limits at \mbox{semi-hourly} intervals. Hitting a limit means that the user account no longer can perform the actions that the limit represents until the time period has elapsed.

\subsection{Flickr}
\label{subsec:ows_flickr}
Flickr is a public image and video hosting service used to store and share photos and videos. Unlike Twitter, a post on Flickr is based on an image or video. The post can, optionally, have a title, a description, or both. However, the post must have exactly one photo or video. Flickr supports multiple image- and video formats, including PNG and MP4\,\cite{FlickrUploadRequirements2022}. Size restrictions are set for each post, depending on the media type. Images uploaded to Flickr can be a maximum of \SI{200}{\mega\byte} and a video can be a maximum of \SI{1}{\giga\byte}. Further, \mbox{free-tier} accounts can only have a total of 1\,000 photos or videos on their account. This corresponds to a maximum of \SI{200}{\giga\byte} of storage if we are only storing images or \SI{1}{\tera\byte} of storage if we store only videos. A mix of images and videos can also be uploaded, which would mean that the maximum storage capacity would be between \SI{200}{\giga\byte} and \SI{1}{\tera\byte}. A Flickr Pro account has unlimited storage on Flickr but is still subject to the \mbox{per-item} limit of \SI{200}{\mega\byte} and \SI{1}{\giga\byte} for images and videos, respectively\,\cite{flickrinc.UpgradeEverythingYou}. Flickr Pro costs between EUR~7.49 to EUR~5.49 per month, depending on the subscription time the user signs up for. The description of a post has a limit of 65\,535 characters according to Shhexy Corin\,\cite{FlickrHelpForum2009}. This has been verified through testing. The title of a post has also been discovered through testing to have a limit of 255 characters.

The images and videos uploaded to Flickr are stored in their original form \textbf{without any compression} and can be downloaded by the user as the same file as was uploaded\,\cite{flickrinc.DownloadPermissions}. Flickr also stores other formats of the file, such as thumbnails. User accounts can restrict who, other than themselves, can download the original image. Restricting who can download the file helps ensure that \mbox{no-one} else can read the original file data, but also requires the user to authenticate with Flickr to download the image meaning it is not possible to anonymously download the image data. Even if the original image cannot be downloaded by anonymous users when such restrictions are set by the original uploader, they can still download other versions of the image. The other versions of the image do not contain the same data as the original image but they look similarly, potentially enabling reverse engineer of the original pixel data. The original video can only be downloaded by the user\,\cite{flickrinc.DownloadPermissions}. Flickr does not state if it will always be possible to download the original versions of the uploaded image or video. Further, Flickr states that it retains the right to remove user content from the service at any time\,\cite{flickrinc.FlickrTermsConditions2020}.

The Flickr \gls{API} defines a query limit of 3\,600 requests per hour per application across all \gls{API} calls\,\cite{flickrinc.FlickrFlickrDeveloper}. However, according to Sam Judson in 2013, this is not a hard limit\,\cite{WhatAreAPI2013}. Although, this source is from almost a decade ago. There is no official information from Flickr about what happens if you break the hourly request limit. The Flickr \gls{API} states that the \gls{API} is monitored on other factors as well\,\cite{flickrinc.FlickrFlickrDeveloper}. If abuse is detected, Flickr reserves the right to revoke \gls{API} keys.
