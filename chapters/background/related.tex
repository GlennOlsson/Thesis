\citeauthor{peters_defy_2014} created a deniable filesystem using a log-based structure in \citeyear{peters_defy_2014}\cite{peters_defy_2014}. The filesystem of my project could be seen as a deniable system in the sense that the data is not actually stored on the device, and if the filesystem is not mounted it could be hard to prove that the user actually has data, even if they for instance would find the twitter account. This was also developed using FUSE\cite{noauthor_libfuse_2021} which I also will be using.
