\section{Steganography}
Steganography is the art of hiding information in plain sight, and has been around for ages. Today, a major part of steganography is hiding malicious code in for instance images, called stegomalware. Stegomalware is an increasing problem and in a sample set over 40\% of real-life stegomalware was found in digital images\cite{SIMARGLStegwarePrimer}. While FFS does will not include malicious code in its images, this stegomalware problem flourish the development of detection techniques of steganography in for instance social medias, and it is of high importance and well researched. 

Twitter has been exposed to allowing steganographic images that contains any type of file easily\cite{TwitterImagesCan}. David Buchanan created a simple python script of only 100 rows of code that can encode zip-files, mp3-files and really any file imaginable in an image of the user's choosing\cite{buchananTweetablepolyglotpng2022}. He presents multiple examples of this technique on his Twitter profile\footnote{https://twitter.com/David3141593}. The fact that the images available for the publics eye is evidence that Twitters steganography detection software might not be perfect. However ot os also possible that Twitter has chosen to not remove these posts\textbf{KEEP LAST 2 SENTENCES?? NOT SURE, FEELS INFORMAL AND MORE OF A DISCUSSION THAN A BACKGROUND PRESENTATION}
