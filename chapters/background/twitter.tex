\section{Twitter}
Twitter is a micro-blog online where users can sign up for a free account and create public posts (tweets) using text, images, and videos. Text posts are limited to $280$ characters while images can be up to \SI{5}{\mega\byte} and videos up to \SI{512}{\mega\byte}\cite{MediaBestPractices}. There is also a possibility to send private messages to other accounts, where each message can contain up to $10\,000$ characters and the same limitations on files. However, direct messages older than $30$ days are not possible to retrieve through Twitter's API\,\cite{RetrievingOlder302018}. It is possible to create threads of Twitter posts where multiple tweets can be associated in chronological order.

Twitter's API defines technical limits of how many times certain actions can be executed by a user\,\cite{UnderstandingTwitterLimits}. A maximum of $2\,400$ tweets can be sent per day, and the limit is further broken down into smaller limits on semi-hourly intervals. Hitting a limit means that the user account no longer can perform the actions until the time has elapsed.
