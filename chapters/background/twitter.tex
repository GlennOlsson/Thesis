\section{Twitter}
Twitter is a micro-blog online where users can sign up for a free account and create public posts (tweets) using text, images, and videos. Text posts are limited to $280$ characters while images can be up to \SI{5}{\mega\byte} and videos up to \SI{512}{\mega\byte}\cite{MediaBestPractices}. There is also a possibility to send private messages to other accounts, where each message can contain up to $10\,000$ characters and the same limitations on files. % FIXME: Cannot get messages older than $30$ days though https://twittercommunity.com/t/retrieving-older-than-30-days-direct-messages-direct-messages-events-list/104901
It is also possible to create threads of Twitter posts where multiple tweets can be associated in a chronological order.
