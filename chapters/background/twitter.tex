\section{Twitter}
Twitter is a micro-blog online where users can sign up for a free account and create public posts using text, images and videos. Text posts are limited to 280 characters while images can be up to 5mb and videos up to 512mb\cite{noauthor_media_nodate}. There is also possibility to send private messages to other accounts, where each message can contain up to 10'000 characters and the same limitations on files. If one would represent an arbitrary file of $X$ bytes, each byte (0x00 - 0xFF) can be represented as a character and we can therefore represent this file as $X$ different characters. Using the same set of characters for encoding and decoding we can get a symmetric relation for representing a file as a string of characters. This text can theoretically be posted on for instance Twitter, as long as the size is smaller than 280 or 10'000 bytes depending on if we would post a public post or a private message.
