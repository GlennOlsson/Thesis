\gls{FFS} is a cryptographic and deniable \mbox{cloud-based} filesystem with free storage through exploiting online web services. Compared to other filesystems, \gls{FFS} is slow and is not suitable as a \mbox{multi-purpose} filesystem, for instance as a hard drive for a computer. It performed poorly even compared to another \mbox{cloud-based} filesystem, \gls{GCSF}. However, one key difference between these two filesystems is that \gls{FFS} manages the cryptography of the filesystem, while \gls{GCSF} delegates this task to Google Drive. This provides security benefits for \gls{FFS}, but might also contribute to the slower computation time. The results also show that even when removing the dependency of an internet connection is \gls{FFS} performing poorly, especially for the read operations compared to \gls{GCSF} and \gls{APFS}. The write operations of \gls{FFFS} perform better than \gls{GCSF} and \gls{FFS}. The read operations of \gls{FFS} and \gls{FFFS} are more similar than the write operations, however, \gls{FFFS} outperforms \gls{FFS} for every read operation test leading to the conclusion that the internet connection and the \gls{OWS} influence the file operations significantly. With better read performance than write performance, \gls{FFS} is best suited as a \mbox{many-read-few-write} filesystem.

While the filesystem is slow, it provides security aspects such as \mbox{end-to-end} encryption and deniability. As long as the filesystem is not mounted to the computer, it is not possible to prove how much data is stored on \gls{FFS}, or even prove that data is stored on \gls{FFS}. However, it is possible to get a upper-limit amount of data stored. \mbox{End-to-end} cryptography provides the user with confidential data. Further, by using authenticated encryption, \gls{FFS} provides the user with proof of the authenticity of the data it stores. 

%TODO: Possible to get an estimate of how much data is stored?
