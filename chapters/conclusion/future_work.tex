% Due to the breadth of the problem, only some of the initial goals have been

% \subsection{What has been left undone?}
% \label{what-has-been-left-undone}

% The prototype does not address the third requirment, i.e., a yearly
% unavailability of less than 3 minutes, this remains an open problem. ...

% \subsubsection{Cost analysis}

% The current prototype works, but the performance from a cost perspective makes
% this an impractical solution. Future work must reduce the cost of this
% solution, to do so a cost analysis needs to first be done. ...

% \subsubsection{Security}

% A future research effort is needed to address the security holes that results
% from using a self-signed certificate. Page filling text mass. Page filling

% \subsection{Next obvious things to be done}

% In particular, the author of this thesis wishes to point out xxxxxx remains as
% a problem to be solved. Solving this problem is the next thing that should be
% done. ...
