% TODO: Sharable files?

As mentioned previously, \gls{FFS} does not implement all features that the POSIX standard defines. Future development for \gls{FFS} could be to implement more of these functions, such as links and file permissions. This could make \gls{FFS} resemble a regular filesystem further. Another improvement could be to move from userspace using \gls{FUSE}, to kernel space. This could speed up filesystem operations. Another feature that could be interesting to evaluate is the possibility to share files with other users, similar to Google Drive.

Even though the files are encrypted so that the data is confidential, further research could include hiding the user's online activity through the use of for instance Tor. Currently, the anonymity of the user is not considered but for \gls{FFS} to be further plausibly deniable, this should be addressed as the user could otherwise be identified by its IP address and other online fingerprints that could be provided by the online web services.

To improve the dependability and increase the storage capacity of \gls{FFS}, support for more online web services could be implemented. For instance, GitHub provides free user accounts with many gigabytes of data. Even \mbox{free-tier} distributed filesystems, such as Google Drive, could be utilized. If multiple user accounts are used in coordination over multiple services, \gls{FFS} could achieve even more storage. Future work includes comparing such a filesystem with the current state of \gls{FFS}.

If the \gls{OWS} would pursue identifying \gls{FFS} images stored on their service to remove them, it would be a problem for \gls{FFS}. Even removing a single image could remove the full functionality of the filesystem. Future work includes finding evasion techniques to hide the hidden data even further. For instance, hiding less data in the images is a possibility which could mean that the images could look like actual images, such as photographs. This is similar to the idea of CovertFS\,\cite{baliga2007web} where a maximum of \SI[per-mode = symbol]{4}{\kilo\byte} per image would be used. However, this would significantly decrease the storage capacity of \gls{FFS}. Part of future work is to explore if more data could be stored in the images, or if multiple \gls{OWS}s could be used to overcome the decreased storage capacity. 

The benchmark tests showed visible patterns, seemingly distinct between filesystems. Future work includes analyzing these patterns to create fingerprints which could be used to identify filesystems based on their benchmark data.
