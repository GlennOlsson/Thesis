\section{Negative impact}
Secure and hidden data is not only for the better good. As the data stored on FFS cannot be decrypted by bad guys nor good guys, illegal data could be stored on the system without anyone knowing about it. It is known that end-to-end encryption does not only have a positive impact on the society, as for instance terrorists are using it to spread their messages across the internet\,\cite{ruddEncryptionCounterterrorismGetting2017}. FFS could potentially provide secure storage for illegal groups such as terrorist organizations and child pornography rings. It is not possible to limit who uses FFS, other than not publishing the source code of the filesystem. However, this does not prevent criminal organizations to use other end-to-end encrypted filesystems or develop their own. Some terrorist organizations consist of well-educated engineers who could provide this technology for its organization\,\cite{berrebyEngineeringTerror2010}.
