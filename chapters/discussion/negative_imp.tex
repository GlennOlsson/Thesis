\section{Negative impact}
Secure and hidden data is not only for the better good. As the data stored on FFS cannot be decrypted by bad guys nor good guys, illegal data could be stored on the system without anyone knowing about it. It is known that end-to-end encryption does not only have a positive impact on the society, as for instance terrorist organizations are known to be using it to spread their messages across the internet\,\cite{ruddEncryptionCounterterrorismGetting2017}. FFS could potentially provide secure storage for illegal groups such as terrorist organizations and child pornography rings. It is not possible to limit who uses FFS, other than not publishing the source code of the filesystem. However, this does not prevent criminal organizations to use other end-to-end encrypted filesystems or develop their own. Some terrorist organizations consist of well-educated engineers who could develop similar technologies for its organization\,\cite{berrebyEngineeringTerror2010}.

\subsection{Environmental impact}
% Stored in data centers rather than locally
%	Always on, consuming energy
%	Requires networking to reach data, uses multiple routers between home and servers
% 	Less power efficient to make a network request than accessing local hard drive

% Stored on Flickr rather than on Google drive
% 	Takes more space, more bandwidth and storage needed
%	Good engineers who can optimize storage efficiency
%	Flickr has good engineers too, and needs to store its data good as well
