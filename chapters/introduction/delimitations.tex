\section{Delimitations} % \todo[inline, backgroundcolor=kth-lightblue]{Avgränsningar}
% \todo[inline]{Describe the boundary/limits of your thesis project and what you are explicitly not going to do. This will help you bound your efforts – as you have clearly defined what is out of the scope of this thesis project. Explain the delimitations. These are all the things that could affect the study if they were examined and included in the degree project.}

Due to limitations in time and as the system is only a prototype for a working filesystem and not a production filesystem, some features found in other filesystems are not going to be implemented in FFS. This includes for instance file access control and symbolic links. The reason is that the goal is to present and evaluate the possibility of creating such a filesystem with a variety of different storage subsystems. The features are more limited to those that are useful in a regular filesystem. However FFS will only aim to implement a minimalistic filesystem. %TODO: This includes reading, deleting and writing files and directories and support for multiple levels of directory hierarchy etc etc
