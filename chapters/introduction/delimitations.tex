\section{Delimitations} % \todo[inline, backgroundcolor=kth-lightblue]{Avgränsningar}
% \todo[inline]{Describe the boundary/limits of your thesis project and what you are explicitly not going to do. This will help you bound your efforts – as you have clearly defined what is out of the scope of this thesis project. Explain the delimitations. These are all the things that could affect the study if they were examined and included in the degree project.}

Due to limitations in time and its unnecessity for a woking filesystem, some features found in other filesystems are not being implemented in FFS. This includes for instance file access control and symbolic links. The reasoning is that we only want to present the possibility of creating a filesystem with a different storage medium and while these features are useful in a regular filesystem, FFS will only aim to be implemented as a minimalistic filesystem.
