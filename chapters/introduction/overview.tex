\section{Project Overview}

This project intends to create a filesystem called \textit{Fejk FileSystem} (FFS) which takes advantage of online web services, such as Twitter, for the actual storage. The idea is to save the user's files by posting or sending an encrypted version of the file as posts or private messages on these web services. The intention is not to create a revolutionary fast and usable filesystem but instead to explore how well it is possible to utilize the storage that Twitter and similar services provides for free as a filesystem. However, the performance and limits of this filesystem will be analyzed and compared to existing alternatives, such as Google Drive, to compare the benefits of this free storage compared to a professional system that might cost money. The security of the filesystem will also be discussed, as well as an analysis of the steganographic capability of the developed filesystem.
