\section{Project Overview}

This project intends to create a filesystem called \textit{Fejk File System} (FFS) which takes advantage of online web services such as Twitter. The idea is to save the files by posting/sending an encrypted version as one or more posts/private messages on these services. The goal is to achieve storage of data in the same scale as the free accounts on online storage services such as Google Drive where users can store up to 15Gb of files. Accomplishing this would mean that one can store more data than that for free using this new filesystem. The data posted will be encrypted and not be comprehensible by anyone who would stumble upon a post, just like if anyone would analyze a regular encrypted filesystem on a disk. 

The intention is not to create a revolutionary fast and usable filesystem but to instead to explore how well it is possible to utilizing the storage that Twitter and similar services provides by allowing users to post text and files, almost unmonitored. The performance will however be analyzed and compared to existing alternatives such as Google Drive.
