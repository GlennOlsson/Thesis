\section{Project Overview}

This project intends to create a filesystem by taking advantage of online web services such as twitter. The idea is to save the files by posting/sending an encrypted version as one or more posts/private messages on for instance Twitter. The goal is to achieve storage of data in the same scale as the free accounts on online storage services such as Google Drive where users can store up to 15Gb of files. Accomplishing this would mean that one can store more data than that for free using this new filesystem.

The intention is not to create a revolutionary fast and usable filesystem but to instead to explore how well it is possible to utilizing the storage that Twitter and similar services provides by allowing users to post text and files, almost unmonitored.

The data posted will be encrypted and not be comprehensible by anyone who would stumble upon a post. Preferably, you should not be able tell that the post is used for storage of data at all.
