Dels vill problemägaren (företaget) få sitt problem löst till det bättre men akademin och ingenjörssamfundet vill också få nya erfarenheter och vetskap. Beskriv ett syfte som tillfredställer båda dessa aspekter.\\
% Det finns även ett syfte till som kan vara värt att beakta och det är att du som student skall ta examen och att du måste bevisa, i ditt examensarbete, att du uppfyller examensmålen. Dessa mål sammanfaller med kursmålen för examensarbetskursen.

The purpose of this research is to explore the possibility to create a secure, steganographic cloud-based filesystem that stores data on online services and to compare the performance, benefits and disadvantages of such a filesystem to existing steganographic filesystems and distributed filesystem services. A distributed filesystem service, such as Google Drive, provide data storage for users which can be both free or cost money. Even though Google Drive encrypt the user's data, they control the encryption and decryption keys, and the method of encryption\,\cite{johnsonGoogleDriveSecure2021}. This means that they can give out the user's files and data if faced with legal actions such as subpoenas. It also opens up the possibility of hackers gaining access to the files without the user having any way to control it.

The idea behind FFS is to have a cloud-based filesystem without anyone except the user being able to control the unencrypted data. We aim to exploit the storage web services give their users for free. By encrypting the files locally before uploading them to these services, the user is the only one who have access to the encryption and decryption keys and therefore unencrypted data. Even if the web service would look at the data uploaded by the user, it is not readable without the decryption key. An interesting aspect of this is that online web services, such as social media, provide users with essentially an infinite amount of storage for free. Anyone can create any number of accounts on Twitter and Facebook without cost, and with enough accounts, one could potentially store all their data using such a filesystem. As the file data is only accessible by the user, and as the filesystem can be unmounted do hide its existence, it is steganographic. 

There are a number of steganographic filesystems available but these lack certain aspects that FFS aims to solve. Some filesystems are based on the local disk of the device in use, such as the physical storage device on a computer or phone, or an external storage device connected to a computer or phone. While such filesystems have advantages such as speed, they lack in accessability as you need to have the device to access the content on it. It also means that when you want to share or transport the data, you must physically move the device which can mean problems as it could for instance be taken from you or be destroyed. Cloud-based solutions counter this by being available from any location that has internet access to the services used. However, existing cloud-based solutions introduce their own disadvantages. Once example is CovertFS\,\cite{baliga2007web} where data is stored in images posted on web services. The images are actual images representing something meaning that there's a limit of how much steganographic data can be stored, and the filesystems limits this to \SI{4}{\kilo\byte} which means that such a filesystem with a lot of data will require many images which could lead to suspicion form the owners of the web services. More examples of filesystems similar to the idea will be presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:related_work}.
