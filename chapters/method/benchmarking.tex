\section{Benchmarking}
This sections describes the methodology and execution of the different filesystem benchmarks. Two different filesystems that are relevant to FFS are compared with the result of two different instances of FFS; one instance that uses Flickr as its OWS, and one instance that uses a FOWS by storing the encoded images in the local filesystem on the test machine.

\subsection{Filesystems}
To analyze the performance of FFS, filesystem benchmarking tools are used to compare FFS against other filesystems that are relevant to FFS. FFS is compared to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An encrypted APFS partition,
	\item An instance of GCSF, and,
	\item An instance of FFS using the local APFS filesystem as its FOWS.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Continue. Justify each filesystem choice
