\section{Development environment specification}
\label{sec:dev_env}
Development of FFS is done on a 2016 years model Macbook Pro laptop with \SI{2.6}{\giga\hertz} Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor and \SI{16}{\giga\byte} \SI{2133}{\mega\hertz} LPDDR3 memory. The storage device of the computer is a \SI{250}{\giga\byte} SSD. The computer runs macOS Monterey 12.3.1. 

FFS is developed in C++20 and compiled using Apple clang version 13.0.0 using target x86\_64\-apple\-darwin21.4.0. It uses the Magick++ library for image processing, which is of version 7.1.0\-29. macFUSE version 4.2.5 is used for FFS to use the FUSE API. FUSE API version 26 is used.

\textbf{HERE WILL BE TEXT ABOUT THE VERSIONS OF THE TESTING CODE AND LIBRARIES USED}

FFS is developed on a single computer for simplicity, and the version used for the operating system, libraries and tools were the most recent up-to-date versions when development of the filesystem started. To avoid unnecessary re-writes of the source code, these versions will remain the same throughout the development process.
