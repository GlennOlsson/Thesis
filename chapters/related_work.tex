The research area of creating filesystems to improve security, reliability, and deniability is not new and has been extensively worked on previously. This chapter presents prior work related to this thesis. This includes other filesystems that share similarities \gls{FFS}, for example, the idea of unconventional storage media and steganography. \Cref{sec:SteganographyAndDeniableFS} introduces the concepts of steganography and deniable filesystems. \Cref{sec:rel_crypto} discuses why this work use \gls{AES} rather than introducing yet another cryptographic system. \Cref{sec:rel_fs} discusses related filesystems. \Cref{sec:iozone} discusses the particular filesystem benchmarking system that has been used. Finally, \Cref{sec:relatedWorkSummary} gives a summary of the information provided in this chapter.
