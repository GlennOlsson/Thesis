Some papers choose to invent their encryption methods rather than using established standards. \citeauthor{chumanEncryptionThenCompressionSystemsUsing2019} proposes a \mbox{scrambling-based} encryption scheme for images that splits the picture into multiple rectangular blocks that are randomly rotated and inverted, both horizontally and vertically, along with shuffling of the color components\,\cite{chumanEncryptionThenCompressionSystemsUsing2019}. This is used to demonstrate the security and integrity of images sent over insecure channels. The paper uses Twitter and Facebook to exhibit this. Despite its improvement and compatibility of a common image format, such as bitstream compliance, due to its \mbox{well-proven} security \gls{FFS} will use \gls{AES} as its encryption method.
