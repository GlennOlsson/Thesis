Some papers choose to invent their own encryption methods rather than using established standards. \citeauthor{chumanEncryptionThenCompressionSystemsUsing2019} proposes a scrambling-based encryption scheme for images that splits the picture into multiple rectangular blocks that are randomly rotated and inverted, both horizontally and vertically, along with shuffling of the color components\cite{chumanEncryptionThenCompressionSystemsUsing2019}. This is used to demonstrate the security and integrity of images sent over unsecure channels. In fact, the paper uses Twitter and Facebook to exhibit this. Despite its improvement and compatibly of a common image format, such as bitsteam compliance, due to its well proven security FFS will use AES as its encryption method.
