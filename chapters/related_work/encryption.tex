Some works choose to invent their encryption methods rather than using established standards. \citeauthor{chumanEncryptionThenCompressionSystemsUsing2019} proposed a \mbox{scrambling-based} encryption scheme for images that splits the picture into multiple rectangular blocks that are randomly rotated and inverted, both horizontally and vertically, along with shuffling of the color components\,\cite{chumanEncryptionThenCompressionSystemsUsing2019}. This was used to demonstrate the security and integrity of images sent over insecure channels. Their paper uses Twitter and Facebook to exhibit their approach. However, in this thesis, because of the \mbox{well-proven} security of \gls{AES}, \gls{FFS} will use \gls{AES} as its encryption method.
