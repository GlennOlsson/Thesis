\citeauthor{petersDEFYDeniableFile2014} created a deniable filesystem using a log-based structure in \citeyear{petersDEFYDeniableFile2014}\cite{petersDEFYDeniableFile2014}. The filesystem of my project could be seen as a deniable system in the sense that the data is not stored on the device, and if the filesystem is not mounted it could be hard to prove that the user has data, even if they for instance would find the Twitter account. This was also developed using FUSE\cite{Libfuse2021} which I also will be using.

\citeauthor{zadokCryptfsStackableVnode} created Cryptfs, a stackable Vnode filesystem that encrypted the underlying, potentially unencrypted, filesystem\cite{zadokCryptfsStackableVnode}. By making the filesystem stackable, any layer can be added on top of any other, and the abstraction occurs by each Vnode layer communicating with the one beneath. There's potential to further stack through continuing layers by using tools such as FiST\cite{FiSTStackableFile}.
