\section{FFS}
\label{sec:res_ffs}
The artifact developed as a result of the thesis is the Fejk Filesystem, FFS, which uses Flickr as its OWS. The source code of FFS can be found on Github\,\cite{olssonFejkFileSystem2022}. The filesystem provides free cloud-based cryptographic and deniable storage as a mountable volume. The filesystem requires the user to provide their own Flickr API keys, and a encryption password. The API keys are used to authenticate with the Flickr API, and the password is used to derive the encryption and decryption keys. These values are passed to FFS as environment variables.
