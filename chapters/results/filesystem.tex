The artifact developed as a result of the thesis is \gls{FFS}, which uses Flickr as its \gls{OWS}. The source code of \gls{FFS} can be found on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/GlennOlsson/FFS}{github.com/GlennOlsson/FFS}\,\cite{olssonFejkFileSystem2022}. The source code consists of $4\,190$ lines of code excluding comments. The filesystem provides free \mbox{cloud-based} cryptographic and deniable storage as a mountable volume for a computer running macOS. The filesystem requires the user to provide their Flickr \gls{API} keys and an encryption password. The \gls{API} keys are used to authenticate with the Flickr \gls{API}, and the password is used to derive the encryption and decryption keys. These values are passed to \gls{FFS} as environment variables.
