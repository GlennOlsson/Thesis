% \todo[inline]{Keep in mind that most of your potential readers are only going to read your \texttt{title} and \texttt{abstract}. This is why it is important that the abstract give them enough information that they can decide is this document relevant to them or not. Otherwise the likely default choice is to ignore the rest of your document.\\

% A abstract should stand on its own, i.e., no citations, cross references to the body of the document, acronyms must be spelled out, \ldots .\\

Many online web services today, such as Flickr and Twitter, provide users with the possibility to post images which are stored on the platform for free. This thesis explores the idea of creating a filesystem which stores its data on an online web service using encoded and encrypted images. The filesystem, named \gls{FFS}, provides users with free, deniable, and cryptographic storage by exploiting the storage provided by these online web services. The thesis compares the performance of \gls{FFS} against two filesystems available. It can be concluded that \gls{FFS} has limitations in mainly speed, making it unviable for multi-purpose usage. However, it's portability and security makes it relevant for certain scenarios.

% TODO: Chip - One of the thinks that was learned is that Twitter could not provide a reliable way of storing data, since the method of encoding images was changes - thus the data could not be recovered from the re-coded images. This lead to a change to using Flickr. However, there remains the risks that they too will change their encoding, hence the stored data will no longer be recoverable.Given the performance results of measurements of the file system this is an nearly completely unacceptable level of performance. Additionally, it is bad from a sustainable development point of view as it is nearly efficient or economically viable.
